# ðŸ‘» Gimbal Ghost Default Gimbals
The default pre-rendered sticks and template for creating your own pre-rendered sticks in Gimbal Ghost. If you have some Blender and Python skillz you can use this repo as a template to create your own custom gimbals for use in Gimbal Ghost.

## How It Works
Gimbal Ghost's rendering speed relies on a pre-rendered set of gimbal images that are generated using the code and models in this repo. Here is a high level overview:
* All possible stick positions for a single gimbal are pre-rendered using a Blender model and python script that interacts with the Blender model.
* The prerender script moves the gimble in the x and y directions within a position range of -500 to 500 where center stick is represented by `(0, 0)`, upper right is `(500, 500)` and lower left if `(-500, -500)`.
* The prerender script then uses Blender to render a frame to an RBGA `.png` image file where the name of the file is the position of the stick in that frame, e.g. `-450_70.png`.
* To save on file space, the prerender script subsamples the posible stick positions only rendering an image for positions in increments of 10 (adjustable in script).
* Information about the prerendered stick frames is stored in a `gg-manifest.json` file which includes information about the image locations, x, y ranges and step size.
